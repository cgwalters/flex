Vern Paxson wrote flex with the help of many ideas and much
inspiration from Van Jacobson.  Original version by Jef Poskanzer.

The fast table representation is a partial implementation of a design
done by Van Jacobson.  The implementation was done by Kevin Gong and
Vern Paxson.

The reentrancy support, including the original nroff version of the
documentation of the API, was written by John Millaway.

W. L. Estes converted the nroff manual into texinfo and further
mangled the manual from there.
