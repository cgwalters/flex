This is flex, the fast lexical analyzer.

Read the file "INSTALL" for general installation directives.  Peek near
the beginning of the file "Makefile.in" for special DEFS values.  On most
systems, you can just run the "configure" script and type "make" to build
flex; then "make check" to test whether it built correctly; and if it did,
then "make install" to install it.

If you're feeling adventurous, you can also issue "make bigcheck" (be
prepared to wait a while). You can run the regression tests if you change to
the TESTS/ directory and issue "make" followed by "make check".
