The flex distribution consists of the following files:

	README		This message

	Changes		Differences between this release and the beta-test

	Makefile
	flexdef.h
	parse.y
	scan.l
	ccl.c
	dfa.c		flex sources
	ecs.c
	main.c
	misc.c
	nfa.c
	sym.c
	tblcmp.c
	yylex.c

	scan.c.dist	pre-flex'd version of scan.l

	flex.skel
	flex.fastskel
	flexskelcom.h	skeleton scanner sources
	flexskeldef.h
	fastskeldef.h

	flex.1		manual entry

	Timings		a brief note comparing timings of flex vs. lex

The files are packaged as a compressed shell archive, which in turn
contains seven shell archives.  Create a directory where you want flex
to live, cd there, and use

	uncompress flex.shar.Z
	sh flex.shar

	sh flex.shar.1
	sh flex.shar.2
	sh flex.shar.3
	sh flex.shar.4
	sh flex.shar.5
	sh flex.shar.6
	sh flex.shar.7

to extract them.

Either move {flexskelcom.h,flexskeldef.h,fastskeldef.h} into /usr/include
or edit {flex.skel,flex.fastskel,flexskeldef.h,fastskeldef.h,scan.c.dist}
and wire in the full pathname of where you are going to keep the include files.

Decide where you want to keep {flex.skel,flex.fastskel} (suggestion:
/usr/local/lib) and move it there.  Edit "Makefile" and change the
definitions of SKELETON_FILE and F_SKELETON_FILE to reflect the full
pathnames of {flex.skel,flex.fastskel}.  For a System V machine, add
"-DSV" to CFLAGS.

To make flex for the first time, use:

    make first_flex

which uses a pre-generated copy of the scanner whose source is in flex.

Assuming it builds successfully, you can test it using

    make test

The "diff" should not show any differences.

If you're feeling adventurous, rebuild scan.c using various
combinations of FLEX_FLAGS, each time trying "make test" when
you're done.  To rebuild it, do

	rm scan.c
	make FLEX_FLAGS="..."

where "..." is one of:

	-c
	-ce
	-cm
	-cfe
	-cFe

and testing using:

	make FLEX_FLAGS="..." test


Format the manual entry using

    nroff -man flex.1
