This is release 2.2 of flex - an alpha release.

The intent behind this alpha release is to weed out most of the
bugs associated with some new features, and to follow up with either
a beta or full 2.3 release by the end of May.

The flex distribution consists of the following files:

	README		This message

	Makefile
	flexdef.h
	parse.y
	scan.l
	ccl.c
	dfa.c
	ecs.c		flex sources
	gen.c
	main.c
	misc.c
	nfa.c
	sym.c
	tblcmp.c
	yylex.c

	libmain.c	flex library (-lfl) source

	initscan.c	pre-flex'd version of scan.l

	flex.skel	skeleton for generated scanners

	flexdoc.1	full user documentation
	flex.1		reference documentation

	Changes		Differences between this release and the previous one

	COPYING		flex's copyright

	MISC/		a directory containing miscellaneous porting-related
			notes (for Atari, MS-DOS, Turbo-C, and VMS)


Decide where you want to keep flex.skel (suggestion:  /usr/local/lib),
but don't move it there yet.  Edit "Makefile" and change the definition
of SKELETON_FILE to reflect the full pathname of flex.skel.

Read the "Porting considerations" note in the Makefile and make
the necessary changes.

To make flex for the first time, use:

    make first_flex

which uses the pre-generated copy of the flex scanner (the scanner
itself is written using flex).

Assuming it builds successfully, you can test it using

    make test

The "diff" should not show any differences.

If you're feeling adventurous, issue "make bigtest" and be prepared
to wait a while.

Install flex using:

	make install
