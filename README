This is release 2.0.1 of flex - a beta release.

The flex distribution consists of the following files:

	README		This message

	Changes		Differences between this release and the previous one

	Makefile
	flexdef.h
	parse.y
	scan.l
	ccl.c
	dfa.c
	ecs.c		flex sources
	gen.c
	main.c
	misc.c
	nfa.c
	sym.c
	tblcmp.c
	yylex.c

	initscan.c	pre-flex'd version of scan.l

	flex.skel	skeleton for generated scanners

	flex.1		manual entry

	COPYING		flex's copyright
	MISC		miscellaneous stuff (e.g., old VMS Makefile) which
			almost no one will care about

The files are packaged as a compressed shell archive, which in turn
contains seven shell archives.  Create a directory where you want flex
to live, cd there, and use

	uncompress flex.shar.Z
	sh flex.shar

	sh flex.shar.1
	sh flex.shar.2
	sh flex.shar.3
	sh flex.shar.4
	sh flex.shar.5
	sh flex.shar.6
	sh flex.shar.7

to extract them.

Decide where you want to keep flex.skel (suggestion:  /usr/local/lib) and
move it there.  Edit "Makefile" and change the definition of SKELETON_FILE
to reflect the full pathname of flex.skel.

For a System V machine, add "-DSYS_V" to CFLAGS in the Makefile.


To make flex for the first time, use:

    make first_flex

which uses a pre-generated copy of the scanner whose source is in flex.

Assuming it builds successfully, you can test it using

    make test

The "diff" should not show any differences.

If you're feeling adventurous, rebuild scan.c using various
combinations of FLEX_FLAGS, each time trying "make test" when
you're done.  To rebuild it, do

	rm scan.c
	make FLEX_FLAGS="..."

where "..." is one of:

	-c
	-ce
	-cm
	-cfe
	-cFe

and testing using:

	make FLEX_FLAGS="..." test


Format the manual entry using

    nroff -man flex.1
