This is release 2.4 of flex.  See "version.h" for the exact patch-level.

Read the "Installation considerations" note in the Makefile and make any
necessary changes.

To make this version of flex for the first time (even if you've already
installed earlier version of flex), use:

	make bootstrap

and then

	make

Assuming flex builds successfully, you can test it using

	make check

The "diff" should not show any differences.

If you're feeling adventurous, issue "make bigcheck" and be prepared to wait
a while.

Install flex using:

	make install
