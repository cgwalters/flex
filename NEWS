* version 2.5.6

** Support for reentrant C scanners has been added.

*** Updated the manual with the new reentrant API.

*** Two new options %option reentrant (-R) and 
%option reentrant-bison (-Rb).

*** All globals optionally placed into struct yyglobals_t.

*** All access to globals replaced by macro invocations.

*** All functions optionally take one additional
argument, yy_globals.

*** New style for invoking reentrant scanner:
yylex_init(void** scanner );
yylex( scanner );
yylex_destroy( scanner );

*** Added get/set functions for members of struct yy_globals_t.
e.g.,  yyget_text, yyget_leng, etc.

*** Prefix substitution added for new functions.

*** Macro shortcuts to the lengthy get/set functions
provided for use in actions. e.g.,  yytext_r, yyleng_r, etc.

*** Arbitrary, user-defined data, "yyextra", may be added to scanner.

** %option nomain no longer implies %option yywrap.
But the inverse is still true.

** Developer test suite added.

*** TESTS/ directory has been added. Users can 
'make check' in the TESTS directory to execute the test suite.

** Support for bison variables yylval and yylloc added.

** automake support for the build process

** manual is now in texinfo/info format

*** flex.1 removed from distribution

** flex no longer generates C-language scanners with C++-style
   comments

** flex now generates scanners in c++ which are compatible with
   recent c++ compilers
