Changes between beta-test release of Feb. '88 and initial release:

	- many files renamed to remove "flex" prefix
	- input() routine added to compressed and fast skeletons
	- unput() routine added to compressed skeleton
	- -d, -ce support for fast scanners
	- symbol table extended to avoid ugly casts of ints <-> char *'s;
	  this may relieve MS-DOS woes
	- actions are now separated with YY_BREAK instead of simple "break"'s
	- fixed bug causing core-dumps if skeleton file could not be opened
	- fixed bugs in logic deciding which options cannot be intermixed
	- initial start condition can now be referred to as <INITIAL>
	- fixed bug which would incorrectly computer trailing context
	  count for a pattern like "(foo){3}"; now this is considered
	  "variable length", even though it isn't.
	- block comments allowed between rules
	- misc. typos corrected
