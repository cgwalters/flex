** added a number of new options

*** All positive %options are now accessible from the command line

*** Added option --header=FILE to specify a C .h file to generate

*** added option --yywrap to call yywrap on EOF

*** added option --yylineno to track line count in yylineno

*** --yyclass=NAME name of C++ class when generating c++ scanners

*** for long option names which are associated with existing short

*** new %option nounistd or command-line --nounistd added to prevent
    flex from generating #include <unistd.h> on systems that don't
    have that include file

%option reentrant-bison (-Rb)

*** All globals optionally placed into struct yyglobals_t

*** All access to globals replaced by macro invocations

argument, yy_globals

*** New style for invoking reentrant scanner:
yylex_init(void** scanner );
yylex( scanner );
yylex_destroy( scanner );

*** Added get/set functions for members of struct yy_globals_t
e.g.,  yyget_text, yyget_leng, etc

*** Prefix substitution added for new functions

*** Macro shortcuts to the lengthy get/set functions
provided for use in actions. e.g.,  yytext, yyleng, etc

*** Arbitrary, user-defined data, "yyextra", may be added to scanner

** %option nomain no longer implies %option yywrap
But the inverse is still true
