* after version 2.5.19

**Flex generates C99 defs now; see YY_TRADITIONAL_FUNC_DEFS in the
  manual if that's not a good thing for you

* version 2.5.19 released 2002-9-5

** prevent segfault on input lines which are longer than the allocated
   space (problem report from Manoj Srivastava
   <srivasta@golden-gryphon.com>)

** Changed option 'header' to 'header-file'.

* version 2.5.18 released 2002-9-4

** portability fixes for integer constants and in the way the test
   suite reports its results

** the test for bison was reporting bison missing when it was, in
   fact, found

** if we don't find GNU indent, we're more careful when we're not
   finding it

* version 2.5.17 released 2002-8-29

** more portability fixes

** updated config.sub and config.guess

** flex is indented by GNU indent (this was done earlier but not
   explicitly documented)

* version 2.5.16 released 2002-8-28

** c++ scanners compile again

** there is now an indent target in the top-level Makefile. configure
   checks for GNU indent which is required for proper operation of the
   indent target

** some more portability fixes were made

** %options and invocation sections of manual merged

** a c++ test was added to the test suite

** we're trying to clean up more files in the test suite's make clean
   targets

* version 2.5.15 released 2002-8-21

** reject-state buffer is now dynamically allocated and REJECT buffer
   variables are reentrant-safe

** manual now discusses memory usage

** skeleton now processed by m4 before mkskel.sh; (this only matters
   if you want to change the skeleton or if you're doing flex development)

** zh_cn translation added from translation project

** a bug that caused a segfault has now been fixed

** the test suite now respects the usual CFLAGS, etc. variables

** removed some warnings which some tests trigggered with the -s option

** the flex-generated header file now tries to be smarter about
   conditionally including start conditions

** tables code omitted from generated scanner when not used

* version 2.5.14 released 2002-8-15

** the tests using the reentrant c scanner as c++ were reworked
   slightly to be sure that the c++ was enforced

** de translation now included in the distribution

** various portability fixes regarding nls support, c++ include
   headers, etc.

* version 2.5.13 released 2002-8-15

** the header file output with %option header is now much smaller

** Fixed type mismatch in printf in scanner skeleton

** yylex_init now reports errors.

* version 2.5.12 released 2002-8-8

** updated gettext support to 0.11.5

** new fr translation from the translation project

** bison is no longer needed to build flex. If you are building flex
   from a release (i.e., not from a cvs snapshot), then you don't need
   to have a pre-built lex around either (unless you modify scan.l, of
   course). (This has been true for some time, but was not mentioned
   here.)

* version 2.5.11 released 2002-7-31

** Fixed bug where yyless did not consider yylineno

** the yylineno performance hit is now gone

** fixed some typos in the manual and we now include texinfo.tex

** traditional prototypes output for C scanners, controlled by a
   preprocessor symbol; see documentation for details

* version 2.5.10 released 2002-7-24

** yy_globals renamed to yyscanner and yy_globals_t renamed to
   yy_guts_t

** added dist-bzip2 option to Makefile.am so we now produce a bzip2'd
   archive in addition to the standard gzip archive

*  version 2.5.9

** new tests in test suite: test-mem-{nr,r}, test-posix,
   test-posixly-correct, test-debug-{nr,r}

** made changes to work with gcc-3.2 development code. (Yes, we were
   doing things wrong)

** ability to choose which memory functions are used in flex

** new yylex_destroy() function for the non-reentrant scanner

** new handling of POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable

** the test suite now has its copyrights explicitly described

** new ca, de, fr, ru, sv, tr translations

* version 2.5.8

** a new --posix option generates scanners with posix-style abc{1,3}
   compatible parsing, see manual for the screwy details

* version 2.5.7

** configure.in now includes a call to AC_PREREQ to enforce the
   requirement for autoconf at least 2.50 (This only effects you if
   you're doing flex development.)

** configure now uses autoconf's versioning information and configure
   --help reports the bug-reporting address for flex

** test suite now only reports success versus failure; reporting
   skipped is problematic under the current setup

** compilation with --disable-nls now works

** flex can now be built in a separate directory

* version 2.5.6

** gettext support added (from gettext 0.11)

*** translations for ca, da, de, es, fr, ko, ru, sv, tr included

** distribution now built under automake 1.6 and autoconf 2.53

** command-line option parsing happens differently now:

*** Added long option parsing

*** Options -n and -c, previously deprecated, now simply do nothing

*** Options are now parsed left to right

** added a number of new options

*** All positive %options are now accessible from the command line

*** Added option -D, to define a preprocessor symbol

*** Added option --header=FILE to specify a C .h file to generate

*** added option --yywrap to call yywrap on EOF

*** added option --yylineno to track line count in yylineno

*** --yyclass=NAME name of C++ class when generating c++ scanners

*** for long option names which are associated with existing short
options, see accompanying documentation

*** new %option nounistd or command-line --nounistd added to prevent
    flex from generating #include <unistd.h> on systems that don't
    have that include file

** Support for reentrant C scanners has been added

*** Updated the manual with the new reentrant API

*** Two new options %option reentrant (-R) and 
%option reentrant-bison (-Rb)

*** All globals optionally placed into struct yyglobals_t

*** All access to globals replaced by macro invocations

*** All functions optionally take one additional
argument, yy_globals

*** New style for invoking reentrant scanner:
yylex_init(void** scanner );
yylex( scanner );
yylex_destroy( scanner );

*** Added get/set functions for members of struct yy_globals_t
e.g.,  yyget_text, yyget_leng, etc

*** Prefix substitution added for new functions

*** Macro shortcuts to the lengthy get/set functions
provided for use in actions. e.g.,  yytext, yyleng, etc

*** Arbitrary, user-defined data, "yyextra", may be added to scanner

** %option nomain no longer implies %option yywrap
But the inverse is still true

** Developer test suite added

*** TESTS/ directory has been added. Users can 
'make test' in the TESTS directory to execute the test suite

** Support for bison variables yylval and yylloc added

** automake support for the build process

** manual is now in texinfo/info format

*** flex.1 removed from distribution

** flex no longer generates C-language scanners with C++-style
   comments

** flex now generates scanners in c++ which are compatible with
   recent c++ compilers

** flex input scanner now recognizes '\r' as an EOL character
