This is the file NEWS for the flex package. It records user -visible
changes between releases of flex

See the file COPYING for copying conditions

** new ca, de, fr, sv, tr translations

* version 2.5.8

** a new --posix option generates scanners with posix-style abc{1,3}
   compatible parsing, see manual for the screwy details

* version 2.5.7

** configure.in now includes a call to AC_PREREQ to enforce the
   requirement for autoconf at least 2.50 (This only effects you if
   you're doing flex development.)

** configure now uses autoconf's versioning information and configure
   --help reports the bug-reporting address for flex

** test suite now only reports success versus failure; reporting
   skipped is problematic under the current setup

** compilation with --disable-nls now works

** flex can now be built in a separate directory

* version 2.5.6

** gettext support added (from gettext 0.11)

*** translations for ca, da, de, es, fr, ko, ru, sv, tr included

** distribution now built under automake 1.6 and autoconf 2.53

** command-line option parsing happens differently now:

*** Added long option parsing

*** Options -n and -c, previously deprecated, now simply do nothing

*** Options are now parsed left to right

** added a number of new options

*** All positive %options are now accessible from the command line

*** Added option -D, to define a preprocessor symbol

*** Added option --header=FILE to specify a C .h file to generate

*** added option --yywrap to call yywrap on EOF

*** added option --yylineno to track line count in yylineno

*** --yyclass=NAME name of C++ class when generating c++ scanners

*** for long option names which are associated with existing short
options, see accompanying documentation

*** new %option nounistd or command-line --nounistd added to prevent
    flex from generating #include <unistd.h> on systems that don't
    have that include file

** Support for reentrant C scanners has been added

*** Updated the manual with the new reentrant API

*** Two new options %option reentrant (-R) and 
%option reentrant-bison (-Rb)

*** All globals optionally placed into struct yyglobals_t

*** All access to globals replaced by macro invocations

*** All functions optionally take one additional
argument, yy_globals

*** New style for invoking reentrant scanner:
yylex_init(void** scanner );
yylex( scanner );
yylex_destroy( scanner );

*** Added get/set functions for members of struct yy_globals_t
e.g.,  yyget_text, yyget_leng, etc

*** Prefix substitution added for new functions

*** Macro shortcuts to the lengthy get/set functions
provided for use in actions. e.g.,  yytext, yyleng, etc

*** Arbitrary, user-defined data, "yyextra", may be added to scanner

** %option nomain no longer implies %option yywrap
But the inverse is still true

** Developer test suite added

*** TESTS/ directory has been added. Users can 
'make check' in the TESTS directory to execute the test suite

** Support for bison variables yylval and yylloc added

** automake support for the build process

** manual is now in texinfo/info format

*** flex.1 removed from distribution

** flex no longer generates C-language scanners with C++-style
   comments

** flex now generates scanners in c++ which are compatible with
   recent c++ compilers

** flex input scanner now recognizes '\r' as an EOL character
