* resolve the items in the to.do directory

** expand the above into individual requests and handle those requests

* the manual:

** do an end-to-end proofread of the manual

** faq

*** clean up the faqs section. The information is good; the texinfo
   could use some touching up.

*** index the faq entries

** create a section on flex design, features, etc.

* address lex-replacement: document or provide an option through
   configure for creating lex and libl.a files (but remember this has
   posix implications)

* getext

** make sure all flex modules use gettext translation facilities

*subdirectories

** in examples/manual, integrate the Makefile.examples into the
    Makefile.am

* test suite

** integrate the test suite into automake's framework

** make test suite more complete

* generic coding

** move as much skeleton code as possible out of gen.c and into
  flex.skl

*  * Automatic management of the input buffer stack. (currently does
    this for the start condition stack, but not for the input
    buffer stack.)

** memory management

*** Complete the memory management api and documentation.

*** create a uniform memory management API

** figure out whether we want to add the capability to have
  auto-generated backout rules

* C++

** revisit the C++ API. We get requests to make it more complete.

* build system

** use bootstrapper

** consider if --enable-maintainer-mode is a good thing
