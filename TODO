* resolve the items in the to.do directory

** expand the above into individual requests and handle those requests

* the manual:

** integrate the items in the faqs/ directory into the manual or code
  or similar (millaway is working on this; much of the FAQS directory
  is old or uninformative)

*** create a section on flex design, features, etc.

* address lex-replacement: document or provide an option through
   configure for creating lex and libl.a files (but remember this has
   posix implications)

* getext

** update gettext support from gettext-0.11 to gettext-0.11.2 %%

** make sure all flex modules use gettext translation facilities

*subdirectories

** in examples/manual, integrate the Makefile.examples into the
    Makefile.am

* test suite

** make test suite more complete

*** add a test for the --posix option %%

** explicitly describe the copyright state of the entries in
   tests/. millaway has assigned the rights to the test suite to me
   and so the test suite will be under the flex license.

* generic coding

** pay attention to the POSIXLY_CORRECT variable (this is from the GNU
   coding standards and is a good idea) %%

** move as much skeleton code as possible out of gen.c and into
  flex.skl

** create a uniform memory management API

** figure out whether we want to add the capability to have
  auto-generated backout rules

* C++

** revisit the C++ API. We get requests to make it more complete.
