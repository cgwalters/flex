* resolve the items in the to.do directory

** expand the above into individual requests and handle those requests

* integrate the items in the faqs/ directory into the manual or code
  or similar

* make flex.texi the authoritative manual

** take the man-isms out of flex.texi

** index flex.texi

** think about dividing flex.texi into more sections and subsections

* repackage the distribution

** address lex-replacement: document or provide an option through
   configure for creating lex and libl.a files

** convert flex to use automake

** gettextify flex

* test suite

** Rewrite tests/Makefile.* so that users do not need to alter it when
   they add tests

** make test suite more complete

** create a script which sets up a new skeleton test directory with a
   correct .cvsignore file and other such niceties

** explicitly describe the copyright state of the entries in
   tests/. should this be public domain by default?

* move as much skeleton code as possible out of gen.c and into
  flex.skl

* create a uniform memory management API

* figure out whether we want to add the capability to have
  auto-generated backout rules
