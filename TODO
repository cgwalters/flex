* sourceforge migration

** Move CVS to sourceforge (estes)

** test the mailing lists (estes)

** inform GNU folks about changeover (estes)

* resolve the items in the to.do directory

** expand the above into individual requests and handle those requests

* the manual:

** do an end-to-end proofread of the manual (this is under way, but is
   going slowly)

** pretty up the dvi output; overflows, etc.

** faq

*** clean up the faqs section. The information is good; the texinfo
   could use some touching up.

*** index the faq entries

*** mention that it's possible to use a variable to scan matching
    brackets, nested comments etc.

** create a section on flex design, features, etc.

* address lex-replacement: document or provide an option through
   configure for creating lex and libl.a files (but remember this has
   posix implications)

* getext

** make sure all flex modules use gettext translation facilities

*subdirectories

** in examples/manual, integrate the Makefile.examples into the
    Makefile.am

* test suite

** integrate the test suite into automake's framework (note that the
   test suite can be run from the top level directory with "make
   check". Still, we want to get it completely under automake's control.)

** make test suite more complete

** add a test for yypush_buffer_state/yypop_buffer_state

* generic coding

** move as much skeleton code as possible out of gen.c and into
  flex.skl

** figure out whether we want to add the capability to have
  auto-generated backout rules

* C++

** have a separate skeleton for c++

** c++ is getting so broken and different from C, that we need to
   reevaluate the usefuleness of c++ in flex

** revisit the C++ API. We get requests to make it more complete.

* distribution

** use bootstrapper

** use clcommit once it's available in a reasonable form

** remove the need for --enable-maintainer-mode; this means putting
   the ChangeLog under cvs control and making sure that the manpage is
   only rebuilt under reasonable conditions
